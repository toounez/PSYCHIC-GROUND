________________


IDEAL FORM 1: THE HERMIT
DANIEL "DANNY" KERSHAW - THE BOY WHO BECAME THE FOREST
Age at Awakening: 11
Current Age: 19
Location: Olympic National Forest, Washington
Awakening Trait: "I just want to be left alone. People are... too much."
________________


THE JOURNEY
Stage 1: Awakening (Age 11)
Danny's PSI manifested during a particularly brutal week at school. Bullied relentlessly, he ran into the woods behind his house and wished he could disappear.
The trees listened.
First Powers:
* Could blend into natural environments (active camouflage)
* Animals didn't flee from him
* Could sense when humans were nearby (up to 100 feet)
Physical Changes:
* Eyes shifted to a mossy green-brown
* Developed an earthy smell (like petrichor)
* Hair grew faster, thicker
Early Behavior:
* Started spending entire weekends in the woods
* Packed lunches, slept in clearings
* Felt relief away from people
* "The trees don't judge. The deer don't mock. It's... quiet."
________________


Stage 2: Alignment (Age 13-15)
Danny stopped coming home regularly. His parents would find notes: "I'm fine. I'm safe. Please don't look for me."
Developing Powers:
* Could communicate with animals (not speech—understanding of intent)
* Could survive on foraged food indefinitely (body adapted to process raw plants)
* Could move through forests without leaving tracks
* Developed night vision
Physical Changes:
* Skin took on a bark-like texture in patches (shoulders, forearms)
* Fingernails thickened into claw-like keratin
* Hair became coarse, almost fur-like
* Grew 4 inches in 6 months (now 6'3")
* Muscle density increased dramatically
Personality Shift:
* Speech became slower, more deliberate
* Uncomfortable with eye contact
* Preferred grunts and gestures to full sentences
* Lost interest in human concerns: "Why do they care about... grades? Jobs? It's all... noise."
The Incident (Age 15): Rangers found his campsite. Tried to "rescue" him. He roared—an actual, bestial roar—and every animal within half a mile converged on the location. The rangers fled.
Danny disappeared deeper into the wilderness.
________________


Stage 3: Manifestation (Age 16-18)
Hikers started reporting a "Sasquatch" in Olympic National Forest. Photos were blurry, but consistent:
* 7+ feet tall
* Covered in matted hair
* Moved with impossible speed
* Eyes that glowed in darkness
It was Danny.
Powers:
* Could control plant growth (vines, roots, thorns)

* Developed a territorial sense (knew when humans entered "his" forest)
Physical Changes:
* Height: 7'2"
* Body covered in thick, coarse hair (brown-grey, like moss)
* Hands and feet enlarged, prehensile
* Teeth sharpened slightly
* Face remained human but... rougher (heavy brow, wide jaw)
* No longer wore clothes (shed them years ago)
Personality:
* Barely spoke human language anymore (maybe 50 words)
* Thought in images, smells, sounds
* Protective of the forest (would destroy illegal logging equipment)
* Terrified humans who got too close (not to harm—to warn)
Ranger's Report (Age 17): "Subject observed from 200 yards. Approximately 7 feet tall. Covered in hair. Bipedal but moves like an ape. When it realized we were watching, it... I don't know how to describe it. It LOOKED at us. And I felt... unwelcome. Not threatened. Just... like we were trespassing. It vanished into the trees. We couldn't track it."
________________


Stage 4: Apotheosis (Age 19, Current)
Danny is no longer human in any meaningful sense.
Final Form:
* Height: 8'1" (still growing)
* Covered entirely in thick, weather-resistant hair
* Face has elongated slightly (stronger jaw, flatter nose)
* Hands can grip tree trunks like a primate
* Feet are prehensile (can climb without hands)
* Eyes are fully adapted for night vision (glow faintly in darkness)
* Voice is a deep, rumbling growl (can still speak, but rarely does)
Powers:
* Master of the Territory: Knows the location of every living thing in a 10-mile radius
* Beast Speech: Can command animals telepathically
* Root Network: Can merge with trees and "travel" through their root systems (emerges miles away)
* Camouflage Mastery: Can become invisible in natural settings (PSI bends light around him)
* Feral Strength: Can uproot small trees, bend steel, kill a bear barehanded
Personality:
* No longer thinks in words
* Experiences emotions in "seasons" (slow, cyclical)
* Content: He has found his place
* Protective: Guards the forest fiercely
* Sad (occasionally): Remembers, faintly, what it was like to be human—misses nothing about it except maybe his mother's voice
Behavior:
* Leaves gifts for his parents at the forest edge (carved wood, feathers)
* Destroys poacher camps
* Guides lost hikers out (from a distance, unseen)
* Avoids humans but doesn't hate them anymore—they're just... irrelevant
________________


HIS APM: "THE WILDKING'S ROAR"
Triggered: Age 16, when a logging company tried to clearcut his section of forest.
Effect:
* Danny became a 12-foot tall, fully bestial giant
* Every animal in the forest answered his call
* Bears, wolves, cougars, eagles—all converged
* For 20 minutes, he was a primal god
* The loggers fled, equipment was destroyed
* One logger swears the trees themselves attacked
Aftermath:
* Permanently gained the ability to command animals en masse
* Lost the ability to read (letters just look like random marks now)
* After the APM ended, he collapsed and slept for a week
* When he woke, he laughed—a deep, rumbling sound
* He said (one of the last full sentences he'd ever speak): "I'm not Daniel anymore. I'm the forest. And the forest doesn't need a name."
________________


THE TRAGEDY:
Danny got what he wanted: to be left alone, to escape the cruelty of civilization, to find peace.
But he's also lost:
* Language
* Human connection
* The ability to go back (even if he wanted to)
* His identity as "Danny" (he barely remembers his name)
PSI gave him solitude.
It just didn't mention he'd become the thing people tell campfire stories about.
________________


Encounter Notes (If Party Meets Him):
* He won't attack unless threatened
* He communicates through gestures and animal sounds
* If someone speaks kindly, he might respond (single words: "Go." "Safe." "Stay.")
* He remembers being human just enough to feel sad about it
* If asked why he lives like this: "Quiet. No... hurt. Trees don't... lie."

Awakening Trait: "If I can make them laugh, they can't hurt me."
________________


THE JOURNEY
Stage 1: Awakening (Age 13)
Becca's PSI manifested during her first middle school talent show. She was bombing—dead silence, a few cruel laughs. Then, in desperation, she made a joke about her own failures.

"I don't remember what we were talking about. But it was funny. Right?"
________________

________________

But she's also lost:
* Genuine human connection
* The ability to be vulnerable
* Her sense of self (she's just "The Comedian" now)

PSI gave her the power to make everyone laugh.
It just didn't mention she'd become the joke.

* She's begging for help but can't say it without making it a bit

________________


THE JOURNEY
Stage 1: Awakening (Age 14)
Carter's PSI manifested during a neighborhood crisis. A gang shooting had left three kids dead. The community was fracturing—fear, anger, grief.
Carter stood on a park bench and spoke.
He didn't plan it. Didn't rehearse. The words just came:
"We're afraid. We're angry. We're hurting. But we're still HERE. And if we're here, we can rebuild. We can make this place safe again. We can honor the dead by LIVING. Who's with me?"
Every person listening believed him.

________________


HIS APM: "THE BANNER UNFURLED"

________________


THE TRAGEDY:
Carter got what he wanted: to make things better, to unite people, to be a hero.
But he's also lost:
* His identity (he's just "The Leader" now)
* Personal desires (can't remember the last thing he wanted for himself)
* The ability to fail (his followers won't let him)
* The ability to step down (what happens to the movement if he leaves?)
PSI gave him the power to change the world.
It just didn't mention he'd have to become the world's hero forever.
________________


Encounter Notes (If Party Meets Him):
* He immediately assesses them (potential allies? Obstacles?)
* Speaks in "we" and "our" ("We must stand together. Our future depends on unity.")
* Cannot have casual conversation (everything is a speech)
* If challenged: "You doubt me? That's healthy. Skepticism is good. But listen—really listen. You KNOW I'm right. You feel it. Don't you?"
* They do. His PSI makes them feel it.
* If someone tries to reach him personally: "Carter died at 18. I'm what's left. And what's left is enough to save everyone."
________________


THE COMMON THREAD
All three got what they wanted:
* Danny wanted solitude → Became a myth
* Becca wanted to be loved → Became a performance
* Carter wanted to inspire → Became a symbol
None of them can go back.
PSI gives. Whether you want it or not.
And the most terrifying question:
Are they happy?
________________


Is this what you envisioned? Three paths, three transformations, three people who got exactly what they asked for—and lost everything in the process?
