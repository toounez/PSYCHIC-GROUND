SARAH KERR - THE TRAGIC MIRROR
Her Ability: Adaptive Mimicry
Sarah's PSI isn't just one type - it's meta-PSI. She can observe and replicate ANY psychic ability she witnesses.
Mechanics:
* Copy Condition: She must see a PSI move used successfully (in combat or demonstration)
* Perfect Replication: She uses it at the SAME rank with the SAME modifiers as the original user
* No Drawbacks: She doesn't suffer Mental Strain (BPSI) or Physical Recoil (HPSI)
* Memory Bank: She retains every ability she's ever copied (17 years of collection)
* Limitations: She can only use abilities she's SEEN. New PSI moves are vulnerabilities.
Why This Makes Her Terrifying:
* She's fought EVERY first-generation PSI user Rainbow Corp captured
* She knows Alpha through Epsilon rank moves across all categories
* She can switch between BPSI and HPSI fluidly (something players can't do)
* She gets stronger every time she fights the party

SARAH'S BACKSTORY - THE PERFECT WEAPON
The Tragedy (1987-2004):
Age 8 (1987): Sarah manifests telekinesis. Moves a toy across her bedroom.
Rainbow Corp notices. They take her from her Baltimore home. Her parents are paid off or mind-wiped (she doesn't know which).
Age 8-12: The Testing Phase
* Isolated in a facility
* Studied, prodded, measured
* They discover her ability isn't just telekinesis
* She can copy other PSI abilities she observes
* Rainbow Corp realizes: She's the key to understanding ALL psychic powers
Age 13-17: The Collaboration Phase
* They make her an offer: "Help us understand PSI, or rot in a cell"
* She chooses to help (survival instinct)
* They bring her other captured PSI kids
* She observes their abilities, copies them, helps Rainbow Corp document everything
* Every kid she helps catalog disappears after
* She tells herself: "They're being helped. They're being cured."
Age 18-21: The Researcher Phase
* Rainbow Corp makes her "Lead PSI Researcher"
* Gives her a lab coat, an office, respect
* She believes she's a scientist now, not a prisoner
* Develops the extraction technology (with her copied knowledge)
* Stockholm Syndrome fully set in
Age 25 (2004): The Trigger Event
* She finds Spin's crash site through tracking PSI radiation
* Places hands on the ship core
* It activates, sends convergence signal
* Rainbow Corp: "Good work, Sarah. Now we can collect them all."
* Sarah: "...And cure them, right?"
* Rainbow Corp: "...Sure. Cure them."
Present Day: Sarah is 26-27 (depending on timeline). She's Rainbow Corp's most valuable asset. And she's starting to doubt.

What She WILL Copy from Your Party:
As the campaign progresses and she fights the teams:
From A Team:
* Balboa's Money-Spread Technique
* McLOvin's paintball color effects
* Yukari's Emergency Tuning (she can repair herself mid-fight)
* Cooper's psychic nail constructs
* Margret's... cleaning? (Actually, her determination/tank abilities)
From B Team:
* Jack's grappling techniques (she becomes a close-combat threat)
* Samy's healing (makes her MUCH harder to kill)
* Snas's PK Rime (cold attacks)
* Derrick's fire abilities (Surtur's Sear, Freyja's Flambé)
* Arthur's precision archery + makeshift adaptability
The Horror: By the final fight, she can use ALL OF THIS.

SARAH AS A RECURRING VILLAIN
She appears throughout the campaign, getting stronger each time:
Encounter 1: Session 7 (Facility Purge)
Sarah "The Observer"
Role: She's not trying to kill them yet - she's studying them
HP: 80
Tactics:
* Stays at range
* Uses copied first-gen abilities only
* Takes notes (literally has a tablet)
* "Fascinating. Your technique is... unrefined. But effective."
* Retreats at 40 HP: "I have what I need. Thank you for the data."
What She Copies: Whichever PSI moves the party uses during this fight
________________


Encounter 2: Session 9-10 (Rainbow Corp Raid)
Sarah "The Enforcer"
Role: Now she's actively defending Rainbow Corp HQ
HP: 120
New Abilities: Everything she copied from Encounter 1
Tactics:
* Uses player abilities against them
* Balboa uses Money-Spread? She uses it back.
* Derrick breathes fire? She breathes fire.
* "I've been practicing. Want to see?"
* Summons Rainbow Corp reinforcements (she can call backup)
Emotional Dialogue:
* If players question her: "You don't understand. I'm SAVING you. Mental Strain will destroy you. Let me help."
* If they mention the kids who disappeared: "They were... They had to be... Rainbow Corp promised..."
* Cracks showing: She's doubting, but not enough to stop
Retreat Condition: 30 HP or Rainbow Corp HQ self-destruct initiated

Encounter 3: Session 12-13 (The Betrayal)
Sarah "The Defector"
Role: She learns the truth about Rainbow Corp
The Scene: The party corners her, or she corners them. But before the fight starts:
Rainbow Corp Commander (via radio): "Dr. Kerr, terminate the subjects and return for extraction."
Sarah: "Terminate? You said we were curing them."
Commander: "The cure IS termination. We extract their PSI and dispose of the husk. You KNOW this, Sarah."
Sarah drops her weapon.
Sarah: "...I knew. Didn't I? I always knew."
This Encounter: She HELPS the party fight Rainbow Corp forces, or at least doesn't fight them herself.
But: She's mentally broken. 17 years of complicity crashes down on her.
________________


Encounter 4: Session 15+ (The Perfect Weapon)
Sarah "The Apex Predator"
Role: FINAL BOSS (before Harvesters)
The Context: After defecting, Sarah is hunted by Rainbow Corp. She goes rogue, but she's FURIOUS:
* Furious at Rainbow Corp for using her
* Furious at herself for enabling them
* Furious at Spin for crashing and causing all of this
* Furious at the PARTY for making her see the truth
Her Plan: If PSI is the problem, she'll remove it from humanity. Use Spin's ship core to create a PSI-nullifying field across Earth. No more powers. No more suffering. Factory reset.
The Problem: This will kill EVERY PSI user on Earth (including the party, including herself).
Sarah: "I've seen what PSI does. The mental strain. The recoil. The Harvesters coming. Humanity isn't ready. I'm ending it. I'm ending US."

FINAL BOSS FIGHT: SARAH KERR, THE PERFECT COPY
Phase 1: The Arsenal (HP 150)
Sarah uses EVERYTHING she's copied from the campaign:
Turn 1: Uses BPSI moves (PK Fire, PK Spark, PSI Guard)
Turn 2: Uses HPSI moves (PK Smash, PK Steel, fire breath)
Turn 3: Uses PARTY moves (their own abilities against them)
Turn 4: Rotates unpredictably
Mechanic: Adaptive Defense
* First time she's hit by Physical → +2 DEF for rest of phase
* First time she's hit by BPSI → Resistance to psychic damage
* First time she's hit by HPSI → Heals 2d6 from fire/emotion attacks
"I've fought everyone. I know every weakness. What can YOU do that I haven't seen?"
________________


Phase 2: The Breakdown (HP 100, triggers at 50% HP)
Sarah stops using copied abilities. She starts using raw, uncontrolled PSI.
Visual Change:
* Her body glows with conflicting energies (BPSI blue + HPSI red)
* She's crying while fighting
* "I just wanted to help. I just wanted to be useful. WHY WASN'T I ENOUGH?"
New Attacks:
Mimic Overload
* Uses THREE different copied abilities in one turn
* Takes 2d6 recoil damage (her body can't handle it)
* Desperate, sloppy, powerful
Identity Crisis
* Randomly switches between personalities of people she copied
* "I'm Marcus— No, Rebecca— No, I'm—"
* Each personality uses a different fighting style
* Players can target specific "identities" to confuse her
Self-Erasure
* AoE 20ft, 3d10 psychic damage
* All targets make DC 18 PSI Control check or lose access to ONE PSI move for 1d4 rounds
* She's trying to delete PSI from existence, starting with herself
________________


Phase 3: The Choice (HP 50 or lower)
Sarah collapses, exhausted. The ship core is active behind her (she's hijacked it).
Sarah: "Just... just let me do this. Please. No more PSI. No more pain. I'll make it quick."
Players can:
Option A: Kill Her
* Standard combat finish
* Prevents her plan
* She dies believing she failed everyone
Option B: Talk Her Down
* DC 20 GUTS check (multiple party members can try)
* Remind her of the kids she helped (even accidentally)
* Show her that PSI can be GOOD
* If successful: She helps them against the Harvesters instead
Option C: Absorb Her
* If someone has similar mimicry/adaptation abilities
* Or if they use Spin's tech
* Sarah's knowledge is preserved, but she dies
* Player gains access to some of her copied moves
________________


SARAH'S THEME: THE MIRROR
She represents what the party could become:
* A tool of the system
* Someone who compromised until they lost themselves
* Power without purpose
Questions she forces the party to answer:
* "Are YOU using your powers to help, or to feel special?"
* "How many people will YOU sacrifice to 'save' humanity?"
* "When the Harvesters come, will YOU make the same choice I did?"
She's the tragic villain who makes players question if they're the heroes.
