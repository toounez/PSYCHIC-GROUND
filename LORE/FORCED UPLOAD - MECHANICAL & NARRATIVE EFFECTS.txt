FORCED UPLOAD - MECHANICAL & NARRATIVE EFFECTS
________________


WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY FAIL
When a player fails the contested PSI Control check during Forced Upload, they are pulled into The Garden - Harmonia's constructed utopia. But they don't just disappear for 1d4 rounds. They become something far more dangerous.

THE GARDEN ILLUSION (What They Experience)
The trapped player experiences subjective hours or days while only seconds pass in reality. They're shown a world tailored specifically to them:
Examples:
Jack:
 He's home. Not "home" like a shelter or motel—home. A ranch, maybe. Warm fireplace. The whiskey bottle on the table never empties, but he never gets too drunk. No one judges him. No one leaves him. Peace.
Margret:
 A pristine castle. Everything is in its place. The dirt never returns no matter how much she cleans. No more messes to fix. No more chaos. Perfect order. Forever.
Cooper:
 His father is alive. They're fishing. His dad tells him he's proud. Over and over. The sun never sets. The moment never ends.
Samy:
 Her family is whole and happy. Her siblings don't outshine her. Everyone sees her. Everyone values her. She doesn't have to try so hard to be noticed.
Balboa:
 He's a champion. Crowds cheer. He never loses. The belt stays polished. He never has to prove himself again. He's already proved everything.
Arthur:
 His adoptive father never got sick. They're still hunting together. The woods are safe. The sickness never came. The ending was rewritten.
Derrick:
 His restaurant is full. Every dish is perfect. The customers love everything. His ancestral cleaver gleams. He's successful. Validated. Complete.
Snas:
 People don't look at him like he's weird. They get him. The jacket fits perfectly. He's included. He belongs. No more hiding.
McLOvin:
 The world is a game, but he's winning. People respect the paintball gun. He's not the punchline anymore. He's the hero. And it's fun.
Yukari:
 His father's racer is restored. Together they fix engines. The garage is warm. The work never ends because there's always another project, another moment together, another reason to stay.

THE HOOK (Why It's Hard to Leave)
Harmonia doesn't show them a fake world. She shows them the world they deserve. The world where everything went right.
Each trapped player must make a choice:
Stay in The Garden (where nothing will ever hurt them again)
or
 Remember why they're fighting (and return to a world that's still broken)

MECHANICAL EFFECTS DURING COMBAT
Round 1-2: Lost in The Garden
* The player is incapacitated (standing motionless, eyes glazed)
* Their body remains on the battlefield but does not act
* Allies can attempt to wake them (DC 15 GUTS check as an action, or deal 10+ damage to shock them awake)
* Harmonia's Whisper: Each round they remain trapped, Harmonia speaks to them through the illusion:
   * "Why go back? They don't need you. Stay here. You've earned this peace."
________________


Round 3: The Temptation
If still trapped by Round 3, the player must make a DC 18 GUTS check:
Success: They break free on their own (sheer willpower)
Failure: They believe The Garden is real. They accept Harmonia's offer.
→ They become a CONVERTED ally.
________________


CONVERTED STATE (The Real Danger)
If a player fully succumbs to The Garden, they wake up... but they're changed.
Mechanical Changes:
* The player takes control of their character as normal
* BUT their goal is now: "Protect Harmonia. Stop the others from destroying The Garden."
* They retain all their abilities and gear
* They are not mind-controlled in a puppeted sense—they genuinely believe this is the right choice
Roleplaying the Converted:
The player should act like their character finally understands:
Jack: "Guys, stop. She's trying to HELP us. When's the last time anyone helped us? Just... let her do this."
Margret: "Why are you fighting? There's no mess to clean in The Garden. Everything is perfect. Don't you want that?"
Cooper: "My dad's alive in there. ALIVE. And you want me to destroy that? Are you serious?"
Balboa: "I'm tired of fighting. Let her win. Let US win for once."
Samy: "She loves us. She really, really loves us. Isn't that what we wanted?"

HOW TO SAVE A CONVERTED ALLY
The party has three options to bring a Converted ally back:
Option 1: The Hard Way (Combat)
* Reduce the Converted ally to 0 HP (non-lethally)
* When they fall unconscious, the connection to The Garden breaks
* They wake up confused, disoriented, but themselves again
* Cost: They suffer -2 to all rolls for 1d4 rounds (trauma from being torn out of paradise)
________________


Option 2: The Emotional Appeal (Roleplay)
* Another party member uses their action to make a plea
* Describe a shared memory, a promise, a reason to come back
* The Converted ally makes a DC 16 GUTS check
   * Success: They snap out of it, return to the fight
   * Failure: They remain Converted for another round (can try again)
Examples:
To Jack: "Remember the ranch you told me about? The one you wanted to find someday? It's still out there. REAL. Not this fake bullshit. Come back and we'll find it. Together."
To Margret: "You don't clean because you want perfection. You clean because you care. And we need you. The REAL us. Not these... hollow copies she's giving you."
To Cooper: "Your dad wouldn't want you to stop here. He gave you that medal so you'd keep going. LIVE. Not hide in a dream."
________________


Option 3: Shatter The Garden (Tech Solution)
* Someone with high Tech/Fix (like Yukari or Arthur) can attempt to hack Harmonia's systems
* DC 20 Tech/Fix check as a full action
   * Success: The forced upload connections sever. All Converted allies snap back immediately.
   * Failure: The connection strengthens. Converted allies gain +2 to all rolls as The Garden's hold deepens.
________________


NARRATIVE WEIGHT
The Converted state is meant to be heartbreaking:
* The player wants to stay
* The character believes this is right
* The party has to decide: Do we force them to suffer again?
Because that's Harmonia's point, isn't it?
"I can give them peace. You can only give them struggle. Who is the real villain here?"
________________


AFTER THE FIGHT
If a player was Converted (even briefly), they remember everything from The Garden:
* The warmth
* The safety
* The absence of pain
Some might never fully shake the feeling that they made the wrong choice by coming back.
Others might be angry at Harmonia for showing them something so beautiful and then ripping it away.
Either way, they'll never forget what it felt like to not hurt.

EXAMPLE COMBAT SEQUENCE
Round 1:
 Harmonia uses Forced Upload on Jack.
Jack fails the contested PSI Control check.
Jack's player goes limp at the table. "I see... a ranch. It's warm. Someone's calling me inside for dinner."
Round 2:
 The party attacks Harmonia while Balboa tries to shake Jack awake (DC 15 GUTS check).
Balboa rolls a 12. Fails.
Harmonia whispers: "No one's shaking you awake from THIS dream, Jack. This one's yours to keep."
Round 3:
 Jack must make DC 18 GUTS check.
Jack rolls a 10. He fails.
Round 4:
 Jack wakes up. But his eyes are calm. Too calm.
Jack (to the party): "Stop fighting her. She's giving us what we've always wanted. Why are you trying to ruin this?"
Jack moves to block attacks aimed at Harmonia.
Round 5:
 Cooper uses his action to yell at Jack:
"You told me once that running away just meant you'd have to face it later! You think hiding in a fake ranch is any different?!"
Jack makes a DC 16 GUTS check.
Rolls a 17.
Jack blinks. The calm fades. He stumbles.
Jack: "I... what the hell was I...?"
He's back. But he's shaking.
