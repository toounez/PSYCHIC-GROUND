PSYCHIC GROUND - CAMPAIGN TONE SHEET
CORE PREMISE
"Endangered children with psychic powers fight to survive systems that want to use them, while finding family in each other."
Six to eleven year olds, pulled from desperate circumstances across America, develop PSI abilities after exposure to alien radiation. Now they're hunted, exploited, and claimed by forces beyond their control. They didn't ask for powers. They didn't ask for this fight. But they're all each other has.

TONAL PILLARS
1. EARTHBOUND DARK
* Children in adult horror - Kids face genuine danger but process it through child logic
* Whimsical brutality - Christmas demons, corporate evil, cosmic entities presented with dark humor
* No graphic violence - Threats are real, but presentation stays "cartoon network dark" not "grimdark"
* Knockouts, not death - Players don't die, they get captured/knocked out (EarthBound rules)
2. DESPERATE BUT NOT HOPELESS
* Bad circumstances, good hearts - Kids came from poverty, abuse, homelessness, war families
* Found family - They protect each other because no one else will
* Small victories matter - Saving one kid, getting a hot meal, finding shelter = real wins
* Agency through adversity - They have power now, they can fight back
3. MULTIPLE UNCONNECTED THREATS
* No mastermind - Bad things happen independently, not orchestrated by one villain
* Overlapping chaos - Rainbow Corp, cosmic entities, personal demons all exist separately
* Messy, not neat - Real life throws everything at you at once, no coordination
* Can't fix everything - Triage, hard choices, accepting losses
4. PERSONAL STAKES OVER EPIC SCALE
* It's about THEM - Not saving the world, saving each other
* Individual arcs matter - Cooper vs WAR, Balboa vs Violence, etc.
* Small scope, deep impact - One kid's trauma is more important than grand conspiracies
* Victories are personal - Breaking cycles, rejecting destinies, choosing who you become

________________


CHARACTER AGE GUIDELINES
Ages: 6-11 years old
What This Means:
✓ They understand mortality but it feels abstract
✓ They're competent but still need protection
✓ They process trauma through play, humor, denial
✓ They're tougher than they should be (survival made them)
✓ Adults should react with horror at their situation
✓ NPCs should treat them as children, not soldiers
✓ They use creativity and teamwork over brute force
Balancing Act:
* Capable enough to fight and survive (PSI powers, desperation)
* Vulnerable enough to need each other (still kids)
* Traumatized but not broken (resilience through found family)
________________


NPC INTERACTION GUIDELINES
How NPCs Should React to Child Soldiers:
Sympathetic Adults (Spin, The Elders, Santa):
* Horror at their circumstances
* "You're too young for this. I'm so sorry."
* Protective instincts, trying to help
* Recognition that kids shouldn't be fighting
Enemy Adults (Rainbow Corp, Antagonists):
* Uncomfortable justifications
* "It's for the greater good" / "Orders are orders"
* Some feel guilt, most suppress it
* Treating kids as assets/threats, not children
Villains (Sarah Kerr, Colonel Reeves):
* See themselves in the kids (were victims too)
* Tragic: trying to "save" them through terrible means
* "I'm sparing you from becoming me"
Cosmic Entities (WAR):
* No moral framework, just hunger/purpose
* View children as resources, vessels, tools
* No empathy, only claiming what's "owed"

COMBAT TONE
Feel: Desperate, Creative, Team-Focused
* Kids use environment, tricks, PSI cleverly
* They're outmatched but scrappy
* Knockouts/capture, not death
* Protecting each other is priority
* Enemies can be scary but not invincible
* Victory feels earned, not easy
* Losses teach lessons (captured allies, failed objectives)
NOT:
* Grimdark ultraviolence
* Kids easily dominating adults
* Plot armor making everything safe
* Enemies being incompetent pushovers
________________


HUMOR GUIDELINES
When to Use Humor:
* Character banter (kids being kids)
* Absurd situations (EarthBound weirdness)
* NPCs being ridiculous (incompetent goons, weird enemies)
* Tension relief after dark moments
* Found family bonding
When NOT to Use Humor:
* Character death/serious injury
* Abuse/exploitation scenes
* Cosmic horror moments
* Heavy emotional beats
* Villain monologues (unless intentionally undercutting them)
Tone Reference: Think EarthBound's "weird mayor obsessed with his own statue" happening alongside "alien invasion destroying the world." Both can coexist.

________________


CONTENT BOUNDARIES
INCLUDE:
✓ Children in danger (captured, hunted, threatened)
✓ Implied abuse/exploitation (off-screen)
✓ Death of NPCs (parents, enemies, bystanders)
✓ Trauma responses (fear, anger, shutdown)
✓ Addiction (Jack's alcoholism, handled seriously)
✓ Poverty and homelessness (Jack's reality)
✓ War and military themes (Cooper's arc)
✓ Cosmic body horror (WAR's manifestation)
EXCLUDE/HANDLE CAREFULLY:
✗ Graphic violence against children (imply, don't describe)
✗ Sexual content of any kind (they're 6-11)
✗ Torture scenes (capture/threat yes, detailed pain no)
✗ Animal abuse (can exist but minimize)
✗ Suicide ideation (depression yes, explicit ideation no)
✗ Detailed gore (blood exists, intestines don't)
Rule of Thumb: "Would this be in a dark Cartoon Network show?" (Adventure Time, Gravity Falls, Steven Universe) - If yes, it's probably fine.

Tone:
* EarthBound (quirky darkness, kids vs cosmic)
* Stranger Things S1 (kids in danger, found family)

________________


QUICK REFERENCE: IS THIS ON-TONE?
ASK YOURSELF:
1. Does this respect the kids' ages? (They're 6-11, not teenagers)
2. Is there hope mixed with darkness? (Not grimdark, not sanitized)
3. Are threats independent? (No mastermind controlling everything)
4. Do personal stakes matter more than epic scale? (Save the friend > save the world)
5. Would this fit in EarthBound? (Weird, dark, but ultimately hopeful)
If yes to most: You're on tone.
 If no to most: Adjust.

ENDING GOALS
Campaign Success Looks Like:
* Kids survive and stay together (found family intact)
* They've rejected the roles forced on them (broken cycles)
* Rainbow Corp is dismantled or significantly damaged (systemic threat reduced)
* Personal demons are faced, if not defeated (character growth)
* They're still kids, just kids with powers and trauma and each other
* Not "happily ever after" but "we made it through together"
Avoid:
* Everyone dies tragically (too dark)
* Everything's perfect now (too light)
* Cosmic ascension/chosen one payoff (wrong genre)
* Separating the found family (betrays core theme)
________________


THIS IS PSYCHIC GROUND.
Kids who never asked for powers, fighting threats they never deserved, finding family in the only people who understand.
Dark, but not without light.
 Hopeful, but not naive.
 Grounded, despite the psychic powers.
