THE PARALLEL CONVERGENCE THEORY
The Core Concept:
Both teams experience similar events, but with small, subtle differences that hint they're in parallel timelines/realities. Then, for a special session, the realities merge.
________________


How It Works:
The Same, But Different:
Both teams experience Session 4 (Polar Express), but with variations:
A Team (Timeline Alpha):
* Train departs at 7:00 PM
* Hot chocolate is peppermint
* Conductor has a gold pocket watch
* Krampus's chains are black iron
* Santa's workshop is traditional red/green
B Team (Timeline Beta):
* Train departs at 7:07 PM (the lucky number, like Arthur's father's watch)
* Hot chocolate is cinnamon
* Conductor has a silver pocket watch
* Krampus's chains are blue-tinged frost iron
* Santa's workshop is silver/white with aurora lights
The players probably won't notice at first. But YOU track the differences.
________________


Subtle Hints Throughout Campaign:
As sessions progress, drop increasingly obvious clues:
Session 5 (Kansas - Dorothy):
A Team:
* Dorothy has been trapped for 10 years (since 1994)
* Rainbow Corp founded in 1992
* Toto's collar says "1994"
B Team:
* Dorothy has been trapped for 10 years (since 1996)
* Rainbow Corp founded in 1994
* Toto's collar says "1996"
If players compare notes between groups: "Wait, your dates are different?"
________________


Session 6 Options:
If both pick the same location (e.g., Nevada School):
A Team encounters:
* Principal Wildfire, age 52
* School founded 2004
* 200 students trapped
B Team encounters:
* Principal Wildfire, age 54
* School founded 2002
* 215 students trapped
Same person, same place, slightly different.

The Big Reveal: Spin Explains
When players start comparing notes (or you decide it's time), Spin comes clean:
Spin: "...Okay, so. I wasn't going to tell you this yet, but... my ship didn't just crash in ONE timeline. The impact was so violent it cracked reality. There are at least two of you. Maybe more."
The Truth:
* Spin's crash in 1984 created a dimensional fracture
* His ship exists in multiple parallel Earths simultaneously
* The PSI radiation leaked into BOTH timelines
* The "convergence" is pulling kids from BOTH realities to BOTH Maryland crash sites
* Rainbow Corp exists in both timelines (and they're cooperating across the barrier)
* The Harvesters will arrive in BOTH timelines unless stopped
Why This Matters:
* Each team has been fighting in their own reality
* But Rainbow Corp has been sharing data across timelines
* If one team fails, Rainbow Corp in the other timeline gets the intel
* They need to work together

THE COLLISION EVENT - Special Session
When to Run It:
After both teams have done 2-3 missions in their respective timelines. They're established, comfortable, think they understand the world.
Then: everything breaks.
________________


The Setup: Reality Fracture
What Triggers It:
Pick one:
1. Rainbow Corp did it - They're trying to merge timelines to double their PSI harvest
2. Spin's ship is failing - The core can't maintain the barrier anymore
3. The Harvesters are coming - Their approach is breaking down dimensional walls
4. One team did something catastrophic - Destroyed a facility, killed a boss, triggered a failsafe
The Effect:
Both teams are in the middle of a normal session when:
* Reality flickers
* Colors invert for a moment
* Everyone makes DC 15 PSI Control check or takes 2d6 psychic damage
* Spin screams in both timelines simultaneously
Spin: "NO NO NO NO— THE BARRIER—"
FLASH.
Both teams are now in the same physical space. Timeline Alpha and Timeline Beta have merged into Timeline Omega.

THE COLLISION SESSION - Structure
Act 1: Confusion (30 min)
Both teams are suddenly in the same location (Maryland crash site, for example).
Initial Reactions:
* "Who the hell are YOU?"
* "Wait, there's TWO McLovins—" "No, I'M McLOvin!" "Then who's—"
* "Why does that guy look like Balboa but... not?"
* Wait, they're not duplicates. They're DIFFERENT PEOPLE.
Spin appears (there's only ONE Spin): "Okay, everyone STOP. Let me explain. You're all real. You're all from Earth. Just... different Earths. And now you're stuck in the same one."
The Problem:
* Timeline collapse is unstable
* Reality is breaking down around the crash site
* Rainbow Corp knows and is sending teams from BOTH timelines to capture everyone
* The ship core is the only thing holding this merged reality together
* If it fails, both timelines collapse into nothing
________________


Act 2: The Siege (2 hours)
The Challenge: Defend the crash site from dual Rainbow Corp assault
Enemy Composition:
* Alpha Timeline Rainbow Corp - more tech-focused, security drones, tactical teams
* Beta Timeline Rainbow Corp - more PSI-focused, mind-controlled soldiers, extracted abilities
* They're coordinating across both timelines (walkie-talkies connected?)
Wave Structure:
Wave 1: Recon Teams (Warm-up)
* 3 Alpha guards (HP 30, tactical gear)
* 3 Beta guards (HP 30, PSI-infused)
* Both teams need to learn to work together
Wave 2: Specialized Units
* Alpha sends Mech Suits (HP 50, armor-focused)
* Beta sends Mind Breakers (HP 40, PSI attacks)
* Teams must split focus or coordinate
Wave 3: The Directors
* Director Greene from Timeline Alpha (Nevada school principal)
* Director Someone New from Timeline Beta (maybe Sarah Kerr?)
* They're working together - combo attacks across timelines
________________


Act 3: The Choice (1 hour)
After defeating the Rainbow Corp assault, the teams face a problem:
Spin: "The merge is unstable. I can't hold both timelines together indefinitely. You have three options:"
Option A: Separate
* Spin uses the ship core to split the timelines again
* Both teams return to their own realities
* But: Rainbow Corp now knows about both timelines and will coordinate
Option B: Merge Permanently
* Force the two timelines to become one stable reality
* All 10 players now exist in the same world
* But: The dimensional scar makes Earth visible to the Harvesters (accelerates their arrival)
Option C: Collapse One
* Sacrifice one timeline to stabilize the other
* One team ceases to exist (obviously not a real option, but Spin presents it)
* Players reject this immediately, but it sets up moral stakes
The REAL Solution (players must figure out):
* Use the ship core to stabilize BOTH timelines separately
* But create a controlled bridge between them (specific locations where crossing is possible)
* Spin can maintain this, but it drains his power
* Teams can reunite for big missions but usually operate separately

POST-COLLISION CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE
After the merge event, you have flexibility:
Regular Sessions (Separate Timelines):
* A Team and B Team continue in their own realities
* But they can communicate now (psychic link, special items, Spin coordinates)
* "Hey B Team, we just hit the Nevada facility. Rainbow Corp's gonna reinforce yours."
Special Events (Merged Sessions):
* Every 3-4 sessions, run a combined session
* Both timelines merge temporarily for major story beats
* Examples:
   * Raiding Rainbow Corp HQ (need both teams)
   * First Harvester scout arrives (affects both timelines)
   * Rescuing Spin's ship core from theft
   * Final boss (Sarah Kerr with combined timeline powers)
The End Goal:
* Both teams working toward the same objective: stop the Harvesters
* But from two different angles, two different realities
* Final session: All 10 players vs the Harvester arrival

MECHANICAL CONSIDERATIONS
How to Run Combined Sessions:
Option 1: Large Battle Map
* 10 players + Spin + NPCs on one battlefield
* Use initiative clusters (A Team acts together, B Team acts together)
* Enemies split attention
Option 2: Split Objectives
* A Team: "Hold the east entrance"
* B Team: "Disable the core in the west wing"
* You bounce between groups each round
* They can't directly help each other but can communicate
Option 3: Tag Team
* Players "tag in" and "tag out" between timelines
* Only 5 active combatants at a time, but they can swap mid-fight
* Represents reality shifting

TIMELINE DIFFERENCES TO TRACK
Keep a doc with key differences:
Event

PLAYER BUY-IN
This concept works IF:
1. Players enjoy the mystery - discovering they're in parallel timelines is cool
2. You sell the reveal well - make it a big moment when Spin explains
3. The collision session is EPIC - 10 players fighting together needs to feel massive
4. You don't overuse it - Combined sessions are SPECIAL, not every week
________________


MY RECOMMENDATION:
Session 4-5: Run normally, same content, subtle differences
Session 6: Continue separate, but players might start noticing inconsistencies
Session 7: THE COLLISION - Big reveal, siege battle, teams unite
Session 8+: Combined timeline structure, occasional crossovers
Final Arc: All 10 vs the Harvesters
